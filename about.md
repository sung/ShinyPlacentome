## Placenta Samples
> All the samples were obtained from the Pregnancy Outcome Prediction Study (**[POPS](https://www.obgyn.cam.ac.uk/research/pops-2/)**) – a prospective cohort study of nulliparous women attending the Rosie Hospital, Cambridge (UK) for their dating ultrasound scan between January 14, 2008, and July 31, 2012.

> A total of __302__ unique placenta samples were considered in this study, among which there were 94 PE, 56 FGR, and 155 control samples – three cases of samples were classified as both PE and FGR. 

> We generated __324__ total RNA-Seq data sets from __302__ unique placental biopsies – __22__ biopsies were sequenced twice (__19__ control samples and __3__ samples classified as both PE and FGR cases). 

> Out of the __302__ placental biopsies, __three__ samples were excluded due to the presence of decidual contamination of the placental biopsies.

> __Three__ cases (i.e. samples classified as both PE and FGR) were also excluded in the analyses (except differentially expressed gene analysis). 

> A further sample was flagged as failed at the library preparation process.

> Thus, a total of __295__ unique placental biopsies were used (__159__ male and __136__ female placentas).
